If you just want the key takeaways, go to the Executive summary. Then, Chapters 2-5 will provide some background on the types of AI systems discussed in the essay. Chapters 5-7 explain why we might expect AGI to arrive soon, and what might happen when it does. Finally, Chapters 8-9 outline a concrete proposal to prevent AGI from being built.
